1)Overview
This project demonstrates Linear Regression using Python’s scikit-learn. It predicts student test grades based on study hours and evaluates performance using statistical metrics.

2)Features
Simple dataset (Hours Studied vs Grades)
Linear Regression model training and prediction
Visualization of regression line with scatter plot
Evaluation metrics: R², MAE, RMSE

3)Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook

4)Results
Add your scatter plot with regression line as an image.
